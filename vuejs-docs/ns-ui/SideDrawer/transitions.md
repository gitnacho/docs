# RadSideDrawer: Transitions

This article explains how to set the transition type of the **RadSideDrawer** with Vue.

## Set transition with Vue

RadSideDrawer offers the following transition options:

* {% typedoc_link classes:FadeTransition %} - provides a fading animation for the displayed drawer content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:PushTransition %} - provides an animation showing the main content being pushed out by the side content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:RevealTransition %} - provides an animation showing the main content uncovering the side content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:ReverseSlideOutTransition %} - provides an animation showing the drawer content reverse sliding out of the main content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:ScaleDownPusherTransition %} - provides a scale down animation of the drawer content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:ScaleUpTransition %} - provides a scale up animation of the drawer content from beneath the main content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:SlideAlongTransition %} - provides an animation of the side content sliding along the main content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:SlideInOnTopTransition %} - provides an animation of the side content sliding in on top of the main content.

The trasition style of the **RadSideDrawer** can be manipulated through the `transition` property of the `RadSideDrawerComponent`, which we have binded to the `transition` data.
