# RadSideDrawer: Callbacks

This article explains how to use the events provided by the **RadSideDrawer** with Vue in order to receive information of the drawer's state.

# Subscribing to events with vue

The **RadSideDrawer** allows you to receive events and execute code when sideDrawer's state is changed.
There are four events that the drawer fires:

* `drawerOpening`
* `drawerClosed`
* `drawerClosing`
* `drawerClosed`

In order to receive these events you need to subscribe for them in the XML where you define the **RadSideDrawer** and provide the actual methods that will be executed when the events are fired:
