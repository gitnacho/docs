# RadSideDrawer Getting Started

This article explains how to create a simple RadSideDrawer with Vue.

> By design the `RadSideDrawer` is designed to be placed as a single child in your component's HTML, this excludes the use of a `<ActionBar><ActionBar>` which is not treated as a simple element by NativeScript and can be used with `RadSideDrawer` by placing it in the beginning of the HTML.

## Installation

Run the following command to add the plugin to your application:

``` Shell
tns plugin add nativescript-ui-sidedrawer
```

## Initialization

Before proceeding, make sure that the `nativescript-ui-sidedrawer/vue` module is required inside your application. This module handles the registration of the custom directives and elements required by [nativescript-vue](https://nativescript-vue.org/).

The RadSideDrawer consists of two visual parts:

* `mainContent` - the visual elements displayed in the host view where the drawer is shown.
* `drawerContent` - the visual elements displayed in the side drawer.

Defining `mainContent` and `drawerContent`  with Vue is done using the `~` syntax:

* `~drawerContent`
* `~mainContent`

The following code snippet is a simple template with a basic setup for RadSideDrawer.
