# RadCalendar - Populating with data
{% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} allows you to define a list of events for a particular date. This is done by using the {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar,member:eventSource %} property. This article describes the steps you need to take in order to feed {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} with your custom events using an events source.

## The `CalendarEvent` class
Feeding events into {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} is done via instances of the {% typedoc_link CalendarEvent %} class. The {% typedoc_link CalendarEvent %} class is model describing a single event. It exposes properties allowing you to specify things like:

* start time of the event
* end time of the event
* whether the event is an 'all-day' event
* title of the event, etc.

To create instances of the {% typedoc_link CalendarEvent %} class you need to import the `calendar` module into your `.ts` file as shown below:

```
import { CalendarEvent } from 'nativescript-ui-calendar';
```

## Create an events service and bind the events to `RadCalendar`
Assuming we have imported the calendar module as instructed above, we can now create a function that will create the events:

<snippet id='calendar-populate-data-vue'/>

We can then use the {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar,member:getEvents() %} method of our service to populate the calendar using its {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar,member:eventSource %} property:

<snippet id='calendar-populate-vue'/>

## Extending the CalendarEvent
If you need, you can extend the `CalendarEvent` with an id to track more easily the selected items or any other information that you need that is missing from the default event. Here's an example:

<snippet id='calendar-custom-event-model-vue'/>

Then you can use the new type to populate the list of items that will be bound to  **RadCalendar**'s `eventSource` property:

<snippet id='calendar-populate-custom-event-vue'/>

## Event view modes
The events for each date cell are shown as dots (iOS) or squares with a summary (Android). **RadCalendar** allows you to show more information about the events by changing the **eventsViewMode** property. The default value is **None** meaning that there will be no additional event representation coming out-of-the-box and the detailed information about events could be added through an additional **ListView** added below the **RadCalendar** and populated with information about events in a selected date. There are other event modes - **Inline** and **Popover** that present similar information within the calendar. Here are the available event view modes:

* {% typedoc_link enums:CalendarEventsViewMode,member:None %} - the default option
* {% typedoc_link enums:CalendarEventsViewMode,member:Inline %} - event details are displayed in a list that appears in the calendar
* {% typedoc_link enums:CalendarEventsViewMode,member:Popover %} - event details are displayed in a popup over the calendar

> All of these values are exposed by the {% typedoc_link enums:CalendarEventsViewMode %} enum defined in the calendar module.

To change the events view mode you need to set the {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar,member:eventsViewMode %} property of {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} to one of these values.
