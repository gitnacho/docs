# Chart Spline Area Series

**SplineAreaSeries** are a type of [CategoricalSeries]({% slug chart-series-overview-vue %} "Chart Series Overview") that present categorical data as points connected with a spline, i.e. a curved line segments and then fill the area between the spline and the category axis. The spline area chart usually visualizes a trend in data over intervals of time, but can also be used to show comparisons among discrete categories.

## Setup

To display a Spline Area Chart, you will need to:

* Add a **RadCartesianChart** to your page.
* Add a category axis (**CategoricalAxis**, **DateTimeCategoricalAxis** or **DateTimeContinuousAxis**) with the **v-tkCartesianHorizontalAxis** directive.
* Add a value axis (**LinearAxis** or **LogarithmicAxis**) with the **v-tkCartesianVerticalAxis** directive.
* Add at least one instance of **SplineAreaSeries** with the **v-tkCartesianSeries** directive and set its **items** property to a collection of data items, its **categoryProperty** set to the name of the property of the data items that will be used to determine their category and its **valueProperty** to the name of the property used to determine their value.

To illustrate this setup, let's create an example. Just like with all vue 'pages' let's start with the `Component` in which we will place our {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} instance. Before that, we would create a basic JS or TS module that contains a collection of objects, which will be used by the chart to provide intuitive data visualization.

### Example 1: Define a collection of items

<snippet id='chart-get-countries-data-vue'/>

### Example 2: Add chart to component's template

<snippet id='chart-spline-area-series'/>
