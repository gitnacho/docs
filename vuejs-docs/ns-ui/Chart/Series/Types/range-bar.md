# Chart Range Bar Series

**RangeBarSeries** are a type of [CategoricalSeries]({% slug chart-series-overview-vue %} "Chart Series Overview") that present categorical data with rectangular bars with heights or lengths proportional to the values that they represent. They differ from **BarSeries** by the fact that they represent two values - low and high and each bar represent the difference between a point's low and high value. The range bar chart usually shows comparisons among discrete categories but can also be used to visualize a trend in data over intervals of time.

## Setup

To display a Range Bar Chart, you will need to:

* Add a **RadCartesianChart** to your component.
* Add a category axis (**CategoricalAxis**, **DateTimeCategoricalAxis** or **DateTimeContinuousAxis**) with the **v-tkCartesianHorizontalAxis** directive.
* Add a value axis (**LinearAxis** or **LogarithmicAxis**) with the **v-tkCartesianVerticalAxis** directive.
* Add at least one instance of **RangeBarSeries** with the **v-tkCartesianSeries** directive and set its **items** property to a collection of data items, its **categoryProperty** set to the name of the property of the data items that will be used to determine their category and the **lowPropertyName** and **highPropertyName** to the names of the properties used to determine their low and high values.

  > The above setup will create a chart with vertical bars. If you need horizontal bars, you can swap the axes' position and add the v-tkCartesianVerticalAxis to the category axis and the v-tkCartesianHorizontalAxis to the value axis.

To illustrate this setup, let's create an example. Just like with all vue 'pages' let's start with the `Component` in which we will place our {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} instance. Before that, we would create a basic JS or TS module that contains a collection of objects, which will be used by the chart to provide intuitive data visualization.

### Example 1: Define a collection of items

<snippet id='chart-get-range-bar-data-vue'/>

### Example 2: Add chart to component's template

<snippet id='chart-range-bar-vue'/>
