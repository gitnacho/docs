# Chart Getting Started

In this article, you will learn to start using NativeScript UI Chart: how to initialize the chart, how to create the data series and how to use the different axes.

* [Plugin Installation](#plugin-installation)
* [Add Chart to Component Template](#add-chart-to-component-template)
* [References](#references)

## Plugin Installation

Run the following command to add the plugin to your application:

``` Shell
tns plugin add nativescript-ui-chart
```

## Add Chart to Component Template

Before proceeding, make sure that the `nativescript-ui-chart/vue` plugin is installed in your main application file (usually `main.js` or `main.ts`). This plugin handles the registration of the custom directives and elements required by [nativescript-vue](https://nativescript-vue.org/).

### Example 1: Register Chat Vue component

<snippet id='chart-imports-vue'/>

Now, you can use all the chart components and directives, as the `RadCartesianChart`, `RadPieChart`, etc. Look at this example component:

#### Example 2: Code of component:

<snippet id='chart-bar-series-vue'/>

#### Figure 1: Chart with BarSeries on Android (left) and iOS (right)
