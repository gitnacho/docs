# Chart Grid

If you followed the [getting started]({% slug chart-getting-started-vue %} "Chart Getting Started") article, you now know how to create a chart and add it to a NativeScript page. In this article, you will learn how to control the grid lines and stripes that can be drawn behind the Chart Series.

* [Getting Started](#getting-started)
* [Properties](#properties)
* [References](#references)

## Getting Started

The grid lines and the stripes between them are controlled by the {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid %} element. It represents a decoration over the plot area of **RadCartesianChart** drawn behind the series. The lines connect the ticks of each axis and the stripes are the area between them. You can set a new grid by declaring an `RadCartesianChartGrid` and setting the `tkCartesianGrid` directive on the instance.

## Properties

* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid,member:verticalLinesVisible %} - Determines whether the grid lines associated with the vertical axis will be visible.
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid,member:horizontalLinesVisible %} - Determines whether the grid lines associated with the horizontal axis will be visible.

* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid,member:verticalStripLinesVisible %} - Determines whether the alternating fills between the vertical grid lines are visible or not.
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid,member:horizontalStripLinesVisible %} - Determines whether the alternating fills between the horizontal grid lines are visible or not.

* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid,member:verticalStrokeWidth %} - Determines the width of the stroke used to paint the vertical grid lines.
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid,member:horizontalStrokeWidth %} - Determines the width of the stroke used to paint the horizontal grid lines.

* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid,member:verticalStrokeColor %} - Determines the color used to draw the vertical lines of the grid.
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid,member:horizontalStrokeColor %} - Determines tthe color used to draw the horizontal lines of the grid.

* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid,member:verticalStripLineColor %} - Determines the color used to paint the fills between the vertical grid lines.
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChartGrid,member:horizontalStripLineColor %} - Determines the color used to paint the fills between the horizontal grid lines.

To better illustrate the Grid capabilities, let's add the following properties to the grid:
