# Preview Your App

Use Sidekick in combination with the NativeScript Playground and Preview apps to quickly run and test your own apps on a device without the need to build them.

## Prerequisites

* Verify that you have installed the Playground app [for iOS from the App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nativescript-playground/id1263543946?mt=8&ls=1) or [for Android from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.play).

## Limitations

The Preview app has several limitations, which you can overcome by [building and deploying your app on a connected device]({% slug deploy-on-device %}).

* **Plugins**<br />The Preview app comes with a predefined set of [NativeScript plugins](https://market.nativescript.org/). If your app needs to utilize a plugin that is not present in the Preview app, you will see a warning message and your app might not work as expected.
* **Resources**<br />The Preview app comes with predefined set of resources, such as app icons, splash screens, and image files. If you need to work with additional files in your application’s `App_Resources` folder, you need to switch to the full setup workflow.
* **Debugging**<br />The Preview app does not allow you to use many of NativeScript’s [debugging tools]({% slug cli-basics %}) - for example, the [integration with the Chrome DevTools]({% slug chrome-devtools %}).
* **Unit Tests**<br />The Preview app does not allow you to use [NativeScript’s unit testing workflows]({% slug unit-testing %}).
* **Lazy Loading**<br />The Preview app cannot run NativeScript apps that use [Angular’s lazy loading technique]({% slug lazy-loading %}) for loading modules.

## Procedure

1. Launch {{ site.ns-sk }} and open your app.
1. From the left toolbar, select **Devices** and then **Preview App**.
1. Click **Start Preview** to generate a QR code.
1. Scan the produced QR code with the NativeScript Playground app to run your app on the device.
