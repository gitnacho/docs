# RadAutoCompleteTextView Suggest Modes

**RadAutoCompleteTextView** has three different modes for providing suggestions.

* {% typedoc_link enums:AutoCompleteSuggestMode,member:Suggest %}
* {% typedoc_link enums:AutoCompleteSuggestMode,member:Append %}
* {% typedoc_link enums:AutoCompleteSuggestMode,member:SuggestAppend %}

The suggest mode can be changed with the {% typedoc_link classes:RadAutoCompleteTextView,member:suggestionMode %} property of the RadAutoCompleteTextView. The default value is {% typedoc_link enums:AutoCompleteSuggestMode,member:Suggest %}.

## Suggest Mode

In `Suggest` mode the autocomplete represents the filtered suggestions, matching the typed text, in a pop-up view, which contains list of the suggestions.

## Append Mode

In `Append` mode the autocomplete shows only the first suggestion matching the typed text, which is represented as direct suffix of the typed text.

## Suggest-Append Mode

In `SuggestAppend` mode the autocomplete combines both upper-mentioned modes. It shows all matching suggestions in a pop-up view and the first of them is appended to the typed text.
