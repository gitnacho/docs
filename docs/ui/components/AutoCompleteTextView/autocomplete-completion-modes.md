# RadAutoCompleteTextView Completion Modes

**RadAutoCompleteTextView** has two modes for filtering suggestions.

* {% typedoc_link enums:AutoCompleteCompletionMode,member:StartsWith %}
* {% typedoc_link enums:AutoCompleteCompletionMode,member:Contains %}

The completion mode can be changed with the {% typedoc_link classes:RadAutoCompleteTextView,member:completionMode %} property of the RadAutoCompleteTextView. The default value is {% typedoc_link enums:AutoCompleteCompletionMode,member:StartsWith %}.

## StartsWith Mode

In `StartsWith` mode the autocomplete shows only suggestions that start with the typed phrase.

## Contains Mode
In `Contains` mode the autocomplete shows the suggestions that contain the typed phrase, but not necessarily in the beginning.
The completion mode `Contains` is not intended to work with the `Append` and  `SuggestAppend`  suggest modes.
 Since these suggest modes append the rest of the suggestion to the typed text, the combination between them and `Contains` won't be helpful but rather confusing.
