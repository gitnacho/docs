# RadDataForm Image Labels

If you followed the [getting started]({% slug dataform-start-source %} "RadDataForm getting started") section, you now know how to edit an object's properties with `RadDataForm` for NativeScript. This article will explain how to remove the text labels of the editors and add appropriate images instead.

* [Usage](#usage)
* [References](#references)

## Figure 1: Show image labels instead of text labels in RadDataForm on Android (left) and iOS (right)

## Usage

By default {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} will load a label for each editor with the name of its property with some formatting applied. In order to remove this you can use {% typedoc_link classes:EntityProperty %}'s {% typedoc_link classes:EntityProperty,member:displayName %} property and change its value to the empty string. With EntityProperty's {% typedoc_link classes:EntityProperty,member:imageResource %}, you can specify the resource name with the image that you would like displayed. You can read <a href="https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/images#adding-android-resources" target="_blank">here</a> how to add image resources to a {N} application. Here's an example which also sets a hint text so that the purpose of the field is more obvious for the user:

### Example 1: Use image resource and hint text instead of displayName for an editor
