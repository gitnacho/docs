# RadDataForm - Provide the Source

This article will guide you through the process of adding a {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} instance to a page in a {N} application and using it to edit the properties of a business object.

## Create the Source Object

In order to use `RadDataForm` to edit an object, we need to have the object that we will edit. In this example, we will create a class `Person`, pass an instance of this class to `RadDataForm` and then we will be able to edit the person's properties. First, let's create a file named `person-model.ts` with the following content:

### Example 1: Declare the object that we will use as a source for RadDataForm

<snippet id='dataform-person-view-model'/>

## Add RadDataForm to the Page

Run the following command to add the plugin to your application:

``` Shell
tns plugin add nativescript-ui-dataform
```

Then, in order to add a {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} instance in a page of your application, you need to define the following XML namespace:

* `xmlns:df="nativescript-ui-dataform"`.

### Example 2: Add RadDataForm to a Page

<snippet id='dataform-getting-started-xml'/>

Note the [data binding](https://docs.nativescript.org/ui/basics#bindings) of the `source` property of `RadDataForm` to the `person` property of the context of the page. In order to provide that context, we will use the `pageLoaded` event as follows:

### Example 3: Define the BindingContext

<snippet id='dataform-getting-started-context'/>

If you run the application now, you should see the default editor for each property of the provided source object.

If you find that a specific field is missing from your form, you should check that the field has been assigned a value in the source object. Fields without a value in the source object will not be displayed.

Our next step is to adjust the editors that are used for each of the source object's properties. [Here]({% slug dataform-start-properties %})'s how.
