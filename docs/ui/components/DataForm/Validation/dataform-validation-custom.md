# RadDataForm Custom Validation

If you followed the [getting started]({% slug dataform-start-source %} "RadDataForm getting started") section, you now know how to edit an object's properties with `RadDataForm` for NativeScript. From the [validation overview]({% slug dataform-validation-overview %} "RadDataForm validation overview") you should have become acquainted with the validation feature in {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %}. This article will show you how to use custom validation in {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %}.

## Custom Validators

If the validators provided by {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} don't fulfil your requirements you can create your own validator. All you need to do, is create a class extending the {% typedoc_link classes:PropertyValidator %} class and override its {% typedoc_link classes:PropertyValidator,member:validate %} method. Here's a sample implementation that validates if the input has an exact content:

#### Example 1: Create a custom validator

<snippet id='dataform-custom-validator'/>

In order to use your validator, you can add it to your `xml` just like the other validators:

#### Example 2: Use a custom validator in RadDataForm

<snippet id='dataform-custom-validator-xml'/>

> Note that you will also need to point the location of your validator definition. For our example the declaration is this: `xmlns:v=\"dataform/validation/custom-validator/exact-text-validator\"`, since our validator is defined in the `exact-text-validator.ts` file in the `custom-validator` directory.

## Manual Validation

Another option is to manually notify {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} for the validation state of its properties and not use the validators at all. Here's an example that manually validates the fields that require validation on a button tap and if they are valid, commits them:

#### Example 3: Custom validation

<snippet id='dataform-custom-validation'/>

Let's walk through that implementation. First, we are getting each `EntityProperty` that we want to validate. Then we check their {% typedoc_link classes:EntityProperty,member:valueCandidate %}. After we check this value, we call {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm,member:notifyValidated %} with `true` if the value is acceptable and with `false` otherwise. We are also setting the property's {% typedoc_link classes:EntityProperty,member:errorMessage %} to the text that we want to have displayed to inform the user why validation has failed. Finally, if all properties are valid, we [commit]({% slug dataform-start-result %} "RadDataForm Get the Result") the result and display a success message. Optionally, we show another message in the case of the failed validation, summarizing the validation errors.
