# Chart Area Series

**AreaSeries** are a type of [CategoricalSeries]({% slug chart-series-overview %} "Chart Series Overview") that present categorical data as points connected with a line and then fill the are between the line and the category axis. The are chart usually visualizes a trend in data over intervals of time, but can also be used to show comparisons among discrete categories.

## Setup

To display an Area Chart, you will need to:
* Add a **RadCartesianChart** to your page.
* Set the chart's **horizontalAxis** to a category axis (**CategoricalAxis**, **DateTimeCategoricalAxis** or **DateTimeContinuousAxis**).
* Set the chart's **verticalAxis** to a value axis (**LinearAxis** or **LogarithmicAxis**).
* Add at least one instance of **AreaSeries**  to the chart's **series** property and set its **items** property to a collection of data items, its **categoryProperty** set to the name of the property of the data items that will be used to determine their category and its **valueProperty** to the name of the property used to determine their value.

To illustrate this setup, let's create an example. First we will create a source with items:

#### Example 1: Define a source with data

<snippet id='categorical-source'/>

We use an instance of this model to assign it as the `bindingContext` of the page we have put our Area series on:

#### Example 2: Update bindingContext

<snippet id='binding-context-area-series'/>

And finally, in the XML definition of the page we put a `RadCartesianChart`, add a AreaSeries instance to it and bind the series to the source of data:

#### Example 3: Add chart to page's markup

<snippet id='area-series'/>

#### Figure 1: Chart with AreaSeries on Android (left) and iOS (right)
