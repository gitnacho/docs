# Chart Line Series

**LineSeries** are a type of [CategoricalSeries]({% slug chart-series-overview %} "Chart Series Overview") that present categorical data as points connected with a line. The line chart usually visualizes a trend in data over intervals of time, but can also be used to show comparisons among discrete categories.

* [Setup](#setup)
* [References](#references)

## Setup

To display a Line Chart, you will need to:
* Add a **RadCartesianChart** to your page.
* Set the chart's **horizontalAxis** to a category axis (**CategoricalAxis**, **DateTimeCategoricalAxis** or **DateTimeContinuousAxis**).
* Set the chart's **verticalAxis** to a value axis (**LinearAxis** or **LogarithmicAxis**).
* Add at least one instance of **LineSeries**  to the chart's **series** property and set its **items** property to a collection of data items, its **categoryProperty** set to the name of the property of the data items that will be used to determine their category and its **valueProperty** to the name of the property used to determine their value.

To illustrate this setup, let's create an example. First we will create a source with items:

#### Example 1: Define a source with data

<snippet id='categorical-source'/>

We use an instance of this model to assign it as the `bindingContext` of the page we have put our Line series on:

#### Example 2: Update bindingContext

<snippet id='line-series-binding-context'/>

And finally, in the XML definition of the page we put a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %}, add a {% typedoc_link classes:LineSeries %} instance to it and bind the series to the source of data:

#### Example 3: Add chart to page's markup

<snippet id='line-series'/>

Here's how your Line chart should look like:
