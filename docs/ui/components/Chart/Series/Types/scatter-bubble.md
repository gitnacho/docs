# Chart Scatter Bubble Series

**ScatterBubbleSeries** are a type of [CartesianSeries]({% slug chart-series-overview %} "Chart Series Overview") that use Cartesian coordinates to display values for typically two variables for a set of data. The data are displayed as a collection of bubble, each having the value of one variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and the value of the other variable determining the position on the vertical axis. Unlike **ScatterSeries** they can visualize a third value (on top of the two value properties) through the size of the bubbles. If you want to show bubbles for categorical data, you can use [BubbleSeries]({% slug chart-series-bubble %} "Bubble Series").

## Setup

To display a Scatter Bubble Chart, you will need to:
* Add a **RadCartesianChart** to your page.
* Set the chart's **horizontalAxis** to a category axis (**CategoricalAxis**, **DateTimeCategoricalAxis** or **DateTimeContinuousAxis**).
* Set the chart's **verticalAxis** to a value axis (**LinearAxis** or **LogarithmicAxis**).
* Add at least one instance of **ScatterSeries**  to the chart's **series** property and set its **items** property to a collection of data items, the **xProperty** and **yProperty** to the names of the properties used to determine where to plot the scatter points and the **bubbleSizeProperty** to the name of the property used to determine the size of the bubble.

To illustrate this setup, let's create an example. First we will create a source with items:

#### Example 1: Define a source with data

<snippet id='scatter-data-source'/>

We use an instance of this model to assign it as the `bindingContext` of the page we have put our Scatter Bubble series on:

#### Example 2: Update bindingContext

<snippet id='binding-context-scatter-bubble'/>

And finally, in the XML definition of the page we put a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %}, add a {% typedoc_link classes:ScatterBubbleSeries %} instance to it and bind the series to the source of data:

#### Example 3: Add chart to page's markup

<snippet id='scatter-bubble-series'/>

## Bubble Scale

Additionally, {% typedoc_link classes:ScatterBubbleSeries %} expose a {% typedoc_link classes:ScatterBubbleSeries,member:bubbleScale%} property which can be used to fine-tune the size of the bubbles according to specific application requirements. The way the {% typedoc_link classes:ScatterBubbleSeries,member:bubbleScale%} property works is by multiplying its value to the radius calculated for each data-point's bubble to determine the bubble's final size.
