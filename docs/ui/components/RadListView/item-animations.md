# RadListView Item Animations
RadListView supports animations for items being added or removed from the list. To be able to utilize this functionality, you will need to bind the module to an `ObservableArray` instance which makes sure any collection changes are reported to the RadListView module.

## Enabling Item Animations
To enable item animations you first need to explicitly define item layout. More information about item layouts is available in the dedicated article: [Item Layouts Animations]({% slug listview-features-item-layouts %} "RadListView item layouts"). The code snippet below demonstrates how a {% typedoc_link classes:ListViewLinearLayout %} is set:

#### __Example 1: Enabling item animations on RadListView:__
<snippet id='listview-item-animations-xml'/>

Note how the {% typedoc_link classes:ListViewLinearLayout,member:itemInsertAnimation %} and {% typedoc_link classes:ListViewLinearLayout,member:itemDeleteAnimation %} properties are set to {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewItemAnimation,member:Fade %}. This means that items being inserted or removed from the source collection will be animated using a fade-in or fade-out animation. There are four different animations that are currently available:

* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewItemAnimation,member:Default %}
* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewItemAnimation,member:Fade %}
* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewItemAnimation,member:Scale %}
* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewItemAnimation,member:Slide %}

The currently available item animation types are defined by the {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewItemAnimation %} enumeration.
