# RadListView Load on Demand

The load-on-demand feature is particularly useful in cases when data needs to be loaded in chunks (pages) to optimize bandwidth usage and improve the UX. The value of the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:loadOnDemandMode %} property determines the mode that will be used for loading on demand. It accepts the values from the {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewLoadOnDemandMode %} enumeration:

* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewLoadOnDemandMode,member:Manual %} - in this mode the user needs to manually request the next data page
* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewLoadOnDemandMode,member:Auto %} - in this mode the next data page is automatically requested as the user approaches the end of the scrollable list
* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewLoadOnDemandMode,member:None %} - in this mode load on demand is disabled

When more items need to be loaded, **RadListView** fires the `loadMoreDataRequested` event. That event will continue to be fired until you set the `returnValue` of the arguments to `false` and call the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:notifyLoadOnDemandFinished(disableLoadOnDemand) %} with a `true` parameter, you can use this when you have reached the end of your data stream and there will no longer be any data to be loaded.

In addition, {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} exposes the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:loadOnDemandBufferSize %} property which determines the count of items left to scroll which when reached triggers a `loadMoreDataRequested` event. This property is used when the load-on-demand mode is set to be {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewLoadOnDemandMode,member:Auto %}.

## Handling the `loadMoreDataRequested` Event

The following code snippet demonstrates how the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:loadMoreDataRequestedEvent %} event is handled. We first need to subscribe for the event as the following XML snippet shows:

### __Example 1: Subscribing for loadMoreDataRequested in XML:__

<snippet id='listview-load-on-demand-xml'/>

in our event handler we make a data request and when the data chunk is ready we feed the list:

### __Example 2: Handling the loadMoreDataRequested in XML:__

<snippet id='listview-load-on-demand-handler'/>

> Here, the usage of a timer is for the purpose of simulating a call to a remote service. The {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:notifyLoadOnDemandFinished(disableLoadOnDemand) %} call is made to inform the list view that the requested data chunk has been delivered.

## Customizing the Load-on-Demand View

To customize the load-on-demand view displayed at the end of the list you need to use the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:loadOnDemandItemTemplate %} property. Here's a simple example:

### __Example 3: Providing a custom loadOnDemandItemTemplate:__

<snippet id='listview-load-on-demand-custom-view'/>

The {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:loadOnDemandItemTemplate %} property is used just like the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemTemplate %} property. Note that the binding context of the view generated from this template is the one assigned to the page.
