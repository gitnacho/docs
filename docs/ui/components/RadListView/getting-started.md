# RadListView Getting Started
This article will guide you through the process of adding a RadListView in your application, binding it to a data-source and visualizing the items by using an item template of your choice. For more information on how each separate feature of {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} is used, please refer to the dedicated articles which are using the same scenario and extend it further. The code snippets from this section are available as [a standalone demo application](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-ui-samples).

## Installation
Run the following command to add the plugin to your application:

```
tns plugin add nativescript-ui-listview
```

## Adding a RadListView to Your Page
Then, in order to add a {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} instance in a page of your application, you need to define the following XML namespace:

* `xmlns:lv="nativescript-ui-listview"`.

After that, you can use the following XML construct to put {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} in your page:

#### __Example 1: Adding RadListView to your Page__

<snippet id='listview-first-look'/>

This will initialize a new {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} instance with a Linear Layout and put it as a direct child of your page.

> You can read more about layouts here: [Item layouts]({% slug listview-features-item-layouts %})

Now we want to prepare a list of items as a source and pass them to the RadListView. Let's create a view-model which will become the binding context of our page and will expose a collection of objects that we will use to populate the control. Create a new file called `view-model` in your application and paste the following code:

#### __Example 2: Creating the models used to feed RadListView with data__

<snippet id='listview-first-look-model'/>

Now, to provide a binding context for the page, we can use the `pageLoaded` event and assign an instance of the view-model to the `bindingContext` property of the page as follows:

#### __Example 3: Assigning the binding context to the RadListView page__

<snippet id='listview-first-look-context'/>

> Note that we have also set the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:listViewLayout %} property to an instance of the {% typedoc_link classes:ListViewLinearLayout %} class. This is needed for the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} to work.

Building and running the application will produce the following result:
