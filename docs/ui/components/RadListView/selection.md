# RadListView Item Selection

{% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} implements a mechanism for selecting or deselecting items. When using the selection mechanism, two selection modes are available:

* Single selection
* Multiple selection

{% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} also exposes convenient API for programmatically selecting or deselecting items and acquiring the currently selected items. The following methods are exposed by {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} to manage selection:

* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:selectAll() %} - selects all available items in the data source
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:deselectAll() %} - deselects all currently selected items from the data source
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:selectItemAt(index) %} - selects the item at the specified index
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:deselectItemAt(index) %} - deselects the item at the specified index if selected
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:isItemSelected(item) %} - determines whether the provided item is selected
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:getSelectedItems() %} - returns an array of the items currently selected

## Enabling Selection in RadListView

The value of the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:selectionBehavior %} property determines how the item selection works. It accepts the values from the {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewSelectionBehavior %} enumeration:

* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewSelectionBehavior,member:None %} - items cannot be selected
* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewSelectionBehavior,member:Press %} - items are selected by tapping on them
* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewSelectionBehavior,member:LongPress %} - items are selected by holding them

Additionally, the value of the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:multipleSelection %} property determines which selection mode will be used. The available options are:

* _multiple selection mode_ - allows for selecting multiple items. `RadListView` keeps track of which items are selected and exposes them through a `getSelectedItems()` method. Multiple selection is enabled by setting the `multipleSelection` property to `true`.
* _single selection mode_ - only one item can be selected at a time. This mode is enabled by setting the `multipleSelection` property to `false`.

## Handling Selection Events

To notify you when the selection state of an item is changed, {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} exposes the following events:

* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSelecting %} - fired before an item is selected. Can be used to cancel the operation
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSelected %} - fired after an item is successfully selected. At this point the item is already in the selected items array returned by the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:getSelectedItems() %} method
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemDeselecting %} - fired before an item is deselected. Can be used to cancel the operation
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemDeselected %} - fired after an item has been successfully deselected. At this point the item is not part of the selected items array returned by the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:getSelectedItems() %} method.
