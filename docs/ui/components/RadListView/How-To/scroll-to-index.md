# RadListView Scroll to Index
This tutorial describes how to scroll a specific item of the RadListView by it's index into the visible portion the UI.

## Implementation

1. All that you need to do is call the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:scrollToIndex()%} of the  {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} instance with an valid integer object as the 'index' parameter. The code snippet bellow shows the described approach, note that the snippet assumes there is an RadListView instance with `id="listView"` set in the XML.

<snippet id='listview-scroll-to-index'/>

## Changing the position of the scrolled to item (iOS only)

When scrolling the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} to show a previously not visible item the default beahvior is that the item will be scrolled into the view either in the `Top` or `Left` position depending on the current `scrollDirection` of the layout. You can easily change that default value by assigning the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:scrollPosition%} to one of these values {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewScrollPosition %}.
