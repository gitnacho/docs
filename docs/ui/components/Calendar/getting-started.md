# RadCalendar Getting Started

This article will guide you through the process of adding a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} instance to a page in a **{N}** application. The code snippets from this section are available as [a standalone demo application](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-ui-samples).

## Installation

Run the following command to add the plugin to your application:

``` Shell
tns plugin add nativescript-ui-calendar
```

## Initialization

Then, in order to add a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} instance in a page of your application, you need to define the following XML namespace:

* `xmlns:calendar="nativescript-ui-calendar"`.

After defining the namespace adding a {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} instance to your page is done as follows:

<snippet id='calendar-getting-started-xml'/>

> {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} must be put in a parent layout panel that does not require from its children to have their own desired size. You should not therefore put {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} in a `StackLayout` or an auto-sized row within a `GridLayout`.

This will initialize a new {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} instance and put it as a direct child of your page:
