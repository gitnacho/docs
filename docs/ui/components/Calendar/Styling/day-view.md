# RadCalendar Day View Styling

In order to apply custom style for this mode, you need to initialize the `dayViewStyle` property of `RadCalendar` with instance of `CalendarDayViewStyle`.
To apply custom style to the cells that are displayed at the top you can use the same properties as in the [styling of the month view]({% slug calendar-monthview-styling %} "Read more about styling in Month view mode"). Additionally the `CalendarDayViewStyle` has `dayEventsViewStyle` and `allDayEventsViewStyle` .

The `dayEventsViewStyle` should be used with a  `DayEventsViewStyle` instance which has properties for the following styling options:

* `backgroundColor` -  defines the background color for the view with the events
* `timeLabelFormat` -  defines the format used to display the time labels in the timeline
* `timeLabelTextColor` -  defines the text color used to display the time labels in the timeline
* `timeLabelTextSize` -  defines the text size used to display the time labels in the timeline

The `allDayEventsViewStyle` should be used with a  `AllDayEventsViewStyle` instance which has properties for the following styling options:

* `backgroundColor` - defines the background color for the area where all day events are presented
* `allDayText` - defines the text that notifies that the top area contains all day events
* `allDayTextIsVisible` - defines wether the text that notifies that the top area contains all day events should be visible


## Example
Here's an example of using the properties mentioned above:

<snippet id='calendar-dayview-styling'/>

This is how the calendar looks like in that case:
