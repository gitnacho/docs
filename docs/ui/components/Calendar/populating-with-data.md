# Populating RadCalendar with Data
RadCalendar allows you to define a list of events for a particular date. This is done by using the `eventSource` property. This article describes the steps you need to take in order to feed {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} with your custom events using a events source.

## The CalendarEvent Class
Feeding events into {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} is done via instances of the {% typedoc_link classes:CalendarEvent %} class. The {% typedoc_link classes:CalendarEvent %} class is model describing a single event. It exposes properties allowing you to specify things like:

* start time of the event
* end time of the event
* whether the event is an 'all-day' event
* title of the event, etc.

To create instances of the {% typedoc_link classes:CalendarEvent %} class you need to import the `calendar` module into your `.ts` file as shown below:

<snippet id='calendar-calendar-require'/>

## Define a List of Events and Bind Them to `RadCalendar`
Assuming we have imported the calendar module as instructed above, we can now create an `Array` of events and assign it to the {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar,member:eventSource %} property of {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %}:

<snippet id='calendar-calendar-event-instance'/>

> The `_eventTitles` array is with example purposes and contains several strings representing event names.

The `calendarEvents` property used at the end of this snippet is exposed by the view-model assigned as a binding context to the page. This allows us to directly bind the {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar,member:eventSource %} property of {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} in our XML file to it:

<snippet id='event-source-binding-xml'/>

Running the application, the following is shown on iOS and Android:

## Extending the CalendarEvent
If you need, you can extend the `CalendarEvent` with an id to track more easily the selected items or any other information that you need that is missing from the default event. Here's an example:

<snippet id='calendar-custom-event-model-ts'/>

Then you can use the new type to populate the list of items that will be bound to  **RadCalendar**'s `eventSource` property:

<snippet id='calendar-custom-event-items-ts'/>

## Event View Modes
The events for each date cell are shown as dots (iOS) or squares with a summary (Android). **RadCalendar** allows you to show more information about the events by changing the **eventsViewMode** property. The default value is **None** meaning that there will be no additional event reperesentation coming out-of-the-box and the detailed information about events could be added through an additional **ListView** added below the **RadCalendar** and populated with information about events in a selected date. There are other event modes - **Inline** and **Popover** that present similar information within the calendar. Here are the available event view modes:

* {% typedoc_link enums:CalendarEventsViewMode,member:None %} - the default option
* {% typedoc_link enums:CalendarEventsViewMode,member:Inline %} - event details are displayed in a list that appears in the calendar
* {% typedoc_link enums:CalendarEventsViewMode,member:Popover %} - event details are displayed in a popup over the calendar

> All of these values are exposed by the {% typedoc_link enums:CalendarEventsViewMode %} enum defined in the calendar module.

To change the events view mode you need to set the {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar,member:eventsViewMode %} property of {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} to one of these values. Here's how {% typedoc_link enums:CalendarEventsViewMode,member:Inline %} looks like:

![TelerikUI-RadCalendar-Event-View-Modes](../../img/ns_ui/calendar-event-view-modes_ios.png "iOS")  ![TelerikUI-RadCalendar-Event-View-Modes](../../img/ns_ui/calendar-event-view-modes_android.png "Android")
