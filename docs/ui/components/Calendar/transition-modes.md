# RadCalendar Transition Modes

* {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar %} supports different animations when switching between months, weeks or years. These are also called *transitions*. Defining a transition is done by setting the - {% typedoc_link classes:RadCalendar,member:transitionMode %} property to one of the values enlisted by the `CalendarTransitionModes` enum.

## Available Transition Modes
