# RadSideDrawer Events
{% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer %} fires several events informing about changes in the component's state. The following events are exposed by {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer %}:
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer,member:drawerOpeningEvent %} - fired when the drawer is about to open
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer,member:drawerOpenedEvent %} - fired when the drawer has been opened
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer,member:drawerClosingEvent %} - fired when the drawer is about to closed
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer,member:drawerClosedEvent %} - fired when the drawer has closed

## Handling RadSideDrawer's events
You can subscribe for {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer %}'s events in the classical {N} way - either in your XML file or programmatically. The following snippets demonstrates a scenario in which all four events are handled by assigning handlers in the XML definition. The source of the handlers is also demonstrated:

<snippet id='sidedrawer-events-xml'/>
<snippet id='sidedrawer-events-handlers'/>
