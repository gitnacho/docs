# RadSideDrawer Transitions

{% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer %} comes with several predefined transitions which are used to animate the drawer and main content panes when switching between open and closed states. The following list presents the predefined transitions:

* {% typedoc_link classes:FadeTransition %} - provides a fading animation for the displayed drawer content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:PushTransition %} - provides an animation showing the main content being pushed out by the side content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:RevealTransition %} - provides an animation showing the main content uncovering the side content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:ReverseSlideOutTransition %} - provides an animation showing the drawer content reverse sliding out of the main content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:ScaleDownPusherTransition %} - provides a scale down animation of the drawer content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:ScaleUpTransition %} - provides a scale up animation of the drawer content from beneath the main content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:SlideAlongTransition %} - provides an animation of the side content sliding along the main content.
* {% typedoc_link classes:SlideInOnTopTransition %} - provides an animation of the side content sliding in on top of the main content.

To use a specific transition, you need to set an instance of it to the {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer,member:drawerTransition %} property of a {% typedoc_link classes:RadSideDrawer %} instance:
