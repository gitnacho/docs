# RadGauge Getting Started

This article will guide you through the process of adding a {% typedoc_link classes:RadRadialGauge %} instance to a page in a {N} application and adding scales and indicators to it. The code snippets from this section are available as [a standalone demo application](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-ui-samples-angular).

## Installation
Run the following command to add the plugin to your application:

```
tns plugin add nativescript-ui-gauge
```

## Adding a RadRadialGauge to your Component
Before proceeding, make sure that the {% typedoc_link classes:NativeScriptUIGaugeModule %} from the *nativescript-ui-gauge* plugin has been imported in an `ngModule` in your app. For example:

``` TypeScript
import { NativeScriptUIGaugeModule } from "nativescript-ui-gauge/angular";

@NgModule({
    schemas: [NO_ERRORS_SCHEMA],
    imports: [
        ....
        NativeScriptUIGaugeModule,
        ....
    ],
    declarations: [
        ....
    ]
})
export class GaugesExamplesModule { }
```

[Demo](https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-ui-samples-angular/blob/master/gauge/app/examples/gauges-examples.module.ts).

To display data the {% typedoc_link classes:RadRadialGauge %} instance is not enough. We should add also add a scale with at least on indicator. In this example we are going to add a {% typedoc_link classes:RadialScale %} with several {% typedoc_link classes:RadialBarIndicator %} instances and one {% typedoc_link classes:RadialNeedle %}. To add a scale to the {% typedoc_link classes:RadRadialGauge %} we should use its {% typedoc_link classes:RadGauge,member:scales%} property. Adding indicators to the scale is similar - we are using {% typedoc_link classes:RadialScale %}'s {% typedoc_link classes:GaugeScale,member:indicators%} property.

In order to setup an `RadRadialGauge` in your Component HTML you will need to follow this steps:

* First start by declaring the `<RadRadialGauge></RadRadialGauge>` tags
* The main elements that are visualized by the gauge are its scales, in order to declare multiple scales simply declare the `<RadialScale tkRadialGaugeScales></RadialScale>` and set the `tkRadialGaugeScales` inline directive to it. The `tkRadialGaugeScales` is an custom inline directive that 'links' the {% typedoc_link classes:RadialScale %} to the {% typedoc_link classes:RadRadialGauge %}.
