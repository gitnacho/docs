# Chart Series Stack Mode

If you followed the [getting started]({% slug chart-getting-started-angular %} "Chart Getting Started") article, you now know how to create a chart and add it to a NativeScript page. In this article, you will learn how the chart will visualize its series if they are more than one.

## Getting Started

There are scenarios in which a single Categorical chart can host multiple series. The {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalSeries,member:stackMode %} property allows you to define how these series will interact with each other. The following options are available for the `stackMode` property:

* {% typedoc_link enums:ChartSeriesStackMode,member:None %} - The data points for all series start drawing from the axis.
* {% typedoc_link enums:ChartSeriesStackMode,member:Stack %} - The data points for each series start drawing from the end of the data points of the previous series.
* {% typedoc_link enums:ChartSeriesStackMode,member:Stack100 %} - The data points for each series start drawing from the end of the data points of the previous series but their size is adjusted proportionally so that the whole plot-area of the chart is filled.

Here's how your chart will look like with {% typedoc_link classes:CategoricalSeries,member:stackMode %} set to `Stack`:
