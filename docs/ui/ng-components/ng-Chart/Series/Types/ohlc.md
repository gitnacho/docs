# Chart OHLC Series

**OhlcSeries** are a type of [CategoricalSeries]({% slug chart-series-overview-angular %} "Chart Series Overview") that are typically used to illustrate movements in the price of a financial instrument over time. That movement is represented by lines visualizing the open, high, low and close price (thus the name Ohlc) for a specific period. Each line on the chart shows the price range (the highest and lowest prices) over one unit of time, e.g., one day or one hour. Tick marks project from each side of the line indicating the opening (starting) price on the left, and the closing (ending) price for that time period on the right. The lines are shown in different colors depending on whether prices rose or fell in that period.

## Setup

To display an Ohlc Chart, you will need to:

* Add a **RadCartesianChart** to your component.
* Add a category axis (**CategoricalAxis**, **DateTimeCategoricalAxis** or **DateTimeContinuousAxis**) with the **tkCartesianHorizontalAxis** directive.
* Add a value axis (**LinearAxis** or **LogarithmicAxis**) with the **tkCartesianVerticalAxis** directive.
* Add at least one instance of **OhlcSeries** with the **tkCartesianSeries** directive and set its **items** property to a collection of data items, its **categoryProperty** set to the name of the property of the data items that will be used to determine their category and the **openPropertyName**, **highPropertyName**, **lowPropertyName** and **closePropertyName** set to the names of the properties used to determine the open, high, low and close values.

To illustrate this setup, let's create an example. Just like with all angular 'pages' let's start with the `Component` in which we will place our {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} instance. We create a basic angular `Component` that contains a collection of objects provided by an custom service, which will be used by the chart to provide intuitive data visualization. The service is a simple 'mock' of an backend call that will return an array of objects:

### Example 1: Define a data service

<snippet id='chart-angular-data-service'/>

Inside that service we have a single function which returns an array:

#### Example 2: Define a source with data

<snippet id='chart-angular-categorical-source'/>

<snippet id='chart-angular-currency'/>

#### Example 3: Add chart to component's template

<snippet id='chart-angular-candlestick-series-component'/>

<snippet id='chart-angular-candlestick-series'/>
