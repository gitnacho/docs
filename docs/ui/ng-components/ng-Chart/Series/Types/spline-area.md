# Chart Spline Area Series

**SplineAreaSeries** are a type of [CategoricalSeries]({% slug chart-series-overview-angular %} "Chart Series Overview") that present categorical data as points connected with a spline, i.e. a curved line segments and then fill the area between the spline and the category axis. The spline area chart usually visualizes a trend in data over intervals of time, but can also be used to show comparisons among discrete categories.

## Setup

To display a Spline Area Chart, you will need to:

* Add a **RadCartesianChart** to your page.
* Add a category axis (**CategoricalAxis**, **DateTimeCategoricalAxis** or **DateTimeContinuousAxis**) with the **tkCartesianHorizontalAxis** directive.
* Add a value axis (**LinearAxis** or **LogarithmicAxis**) with the **tkCartesianVerticalAxis** directive.
* Add at least one instance of **SplineAreaSeries** with the **tkCartesianSeries** directive and set its **items** property to a collection of data items, its **categoryProperty** set to the name of the property of the data items that will be used to determine their category and its **valueProperty** to the name of the property used to determine their value.

To illustrate this setup, let's create an example. Just like with all angular 'pages' let's start with the `Component` in which we will place our {% typedoc_link classes:RadCartesianChart %} instance. We create a basic angular `Component` that contains a collection of objects provided by an custom service, which will be used by the chart to provide intuitive data visualization. The service is a simple 'mock' of an backend call that will return an array of objects:

### Example 1: Define a data service

<snippet id='chart-angular-data-service'/>

Inside that service we have a single function which returns an array:

#### Example 2: Define a source with data

<snippet id='chart-angular-categorical-source'/>

<snippet id='chart-angular-country'/>

#### Example 3: Add chart to component's template

<snippet id='chart-angular-spline-area-series-component'/>

<snippet id='chart-angular-spline-area-series'/>
