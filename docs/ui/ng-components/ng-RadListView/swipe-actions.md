# RadListView Swipe Actions

The "Swipe Actions" feature allows you to implement actions associated with list items which are triggered by swiping the item left or right. For examples, you can organize a TO-DO application and let your users complete or delete to-do items by swiping them. Similar scenarios are also to be found in famous e-mail client apps.
The "Swipe Actions" feature supports the use of interactive elements within the item being swiped, i.e. the main content of the item.

Here's an example of how the Swipe Actions behavior looks on Android and iOS:

> Please note that the items in this example have an explicitly set white background. When using swipe actions, your items should not be transparent, because otherwise the swipe content would be visible through them.

## Enabling Swipe Actions in your RadListView

> For this tutorial we will use the already familiar setup from the [**RadListView: Getting started**]({% slug listview-getting-started-angular %}) section.

To enable the "Swipe Actions" functionality in {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} you first need to set the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:swipeActions %} property to `true`:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-actions-set-enabled-html'/>

> You can also set this property via code

Also note that we have provided handlers for the Swipe Actions events. These handlers will enable you to see which item is being swiped, at what offset and when the user has finished swiping.

Second, you need to define the content that will be shown to the user when they swipe an item. This is done via the `tkListItemSwipeTemplate` inline directive as shown in the HTML snippet below:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-actions-template-html'/>

The swipe template will be a `GridLayout` with three columns. The first and the last column each contain a `StackLayout`. These elements represent the actions revealed by swiping the item either left or right. The second column in the middle is set to take the remaining width of the item so that the two `StackLayout` elements are positioned at both ends of the item.

## Implementing swipe actions

There are two popular ways to implement swipe actions. In the first approach you define a swipe threshold which makes the swiped item stick at a given position (the swipe limit) revealing the swipe actions. The user then taps on a given action to perform it.
In the second approach you simply listen for the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSwipeProgressChangedEvent %} event and once the item being swiped reaches a given threshold, you execute the corresponding action when the  swiped item is released. The following examples demonstrate how these approaches are implemented.

### Tap-to-execute actions

In this scenario the user needs to swipe an item to reveal the actions and then tap on one to execute it. Let's use the swipe template from the XML snippet above:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-actions-template-html'/>

The behavior that we have to implement is as follows:

* user swipes an item
* user releases the item and it sticks open revealing the action(s)
* user taps on an action, an event handler is called and the swiped item is closed

> Note that we have subscribed for the `tap` events of the `StackLayout` elements that are used to represent the actions.

For that purpose we need to use the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSwipeProgressStartedEvent %} event handler and define the swipe parameters that will determine where the swiped item will stick:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-action-release-limits'/>

The `args.data.swipeLimits` object (you can read more about this object at the end of this article) can be used to define the distance an item can be swiped either left or right, as well as the threshold that determines the offset beyond which the swiped item will dock open at the limit position. In this particular scenario, the swipe limits are defined to be the corresponding width of the action element for the left and right sides. The threshold is defined to be half that width. Since the widths of the action elements are the same, we simply use the width of the left element.

So now we have a list with items that can be swiped open revealing an action. Using the `tap` event handlers we provided (as demonstrated in the XML snippet above), we now can understand when our users tap on a given action and execute it:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-action-handlers'/>

> Note that we call the `notifySwipeToExecuteFinished()` method to make sure the swipe item is closed after the action is performed.

### Swipe actions

In this scenario the user needs to swipe and release the item to execute the corresponding action. The item must be swiped at a given distance over the provided threshold so that the associated action is executed. To implement this approach you need to handle the following {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} events:

* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSwipeProgressStartedEvent %} - used to specify the swipe limits in a way that will make the item return to its original place when released
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSwipeProgressEndedEvent %} - used to determine if a swipe action has to be executed (in case the item was swiped beyond a given threshold)
* {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSwipeProgressChangedEvent %} - in case you want to notify the user that they have swiped the item beyond a specified threshold and the swipe action will be executed

So let's look at the handler of the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSwipeProgressStartedEvent %} event:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-action-thresholds-limits'/>

You can see that the width of the list control is used to specify the threshold. The limits for the left and right edges are defined to be half the size of the item (in this case we take the measured width of the swipe-view that comes from the comes from the `tkListItemSwipeTemplate`). That means that the user will never be able to swipe beyond the threshold and once released - the item will always dock at its original position. So what remains is to track the swipe progress using the  {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSwipeProgressEndedEvent %} and trigger the action when the swiped item passes a threshold:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-action-thresholds'/>

In this particular case we have decided that the threshold beyond which an action is considered executed is 1/4 of the whole item width (in this case we take the measured width of the swipe-view that comes from the `tkListItemSwipeTemplate`). Here, we use two flags for each swiping direction. Once the offset of the item being swiped passes the chosen threshold (1/4 of the item width), we raise the flag and use it in the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSwipeProgressEndedEvent %} to understand which action to trigger:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-actions-execute'/>

All swipe events exposed by {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} provide you with a {% typedoc_link classes:ListViewEventData %} object which in turn carries a {% typedoc_link classes:SwipeOffsets %} object through its {% typedoc_link classes:ListViewEventData,member:data %} property. This object exposes the following properties:

* `x` - the X offset of the item being released after swiping
* `y` - the Y offset of the item being released after swiping
* `swipeLimits` - an instance of the {% typedoc_link classes:SwipeLimits %} containing the dimensional limits which restrict the movement of the swiped item. Its properties are as follows:
  + **top** - determines how far from the top edge can an item can be swiped
  + **left** - determines how far from the left edge can an item can be swiped
  + **right** - determines how far from the right edge can an item can be swiped
  + **bottom** - determines how far from the bottom edge can an item can be swiped
  + **threshold** - determines the amount if pixels that needs to be surpassed in any swiping direction so that the item docks open at the provided swipe limit (left or right).
* `swipeView` - the `View` element that represents the swipe content of beneath the item being swiped
* `mainView` - the `View` element representing the main content of the item being swiped

### Animating action views while swiping

Many mobile apps that implement the "Swipe Actions" experience also animate the action views while the user is swiping. This can be easily achieved with {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView %} in the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSwipeProgressChangedEvent %} event. Let's consider the following swipe template:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-actions-multiple-template-html'/>

As you can see, we have a `GridLayout` instance as a root which, similarly to the scenarios described above, defines three columns two of which are taken by two more `GridLayout` instances. The nested instances are set up to have three columns with equally distributed widths. In each of the nested `GridLayout` elements are defined three `StackLayout` elements representing the swipe actions. Now, using the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:itemSwipeProgressChangedEvent %} we will animate the second-level `GridLayout` elements and let their own layout calculate the size of the `StackLayout` instances automatically:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-action-multiple'/>

What we do here is check which swipe direction the user has chosen and trigger a layout for the specific `GridLayout` (left or right) so that it dynamically takes the space that the item being swiped reveales beneath. To improve the UX, we have defined limits for the swipe offset and a threshold which, once passed, makes the item stick open revealing all swipe actions:

<snippet id='angular-listview-swipe-action-multiple-limits'/>

Here are two screenshots demonstrating the behavior on Android and iOS:
