# RadListView Item Selection
The Item Selection feature allows the end users to select items. A couple of selection modes are available, as well as events which are fired when the selection state of an item changes.

The value of the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:selectionBehavior %} property determines how the item selection works. It accepts the values from the {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewSelectionBehavior %} enumeration:
* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewSelectionBehavior,member:None %} - items cannot be selected
* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewSelectionBehavior,member:Press %} - items are selected by tapping on them
* {% typedoc_link enums:ListViewSelectionBehavior,member:LongPress %} - items are selected by holding them

Additionally, the value of the {% typedoc_link classes:RadListView,member:multipleSelection %} property determines which selection mode will be used. The available options are:
* _multiple selection mode_ - allows for selecting multiple items. `RadListView` keeps track of which items are selected and exposes them through a `getSelectedItems()` method. Multiple selection is enabled by setting the `multipleSelection` property to `true`.
* _single selection mode_ - only one item can be selected at a time. This mode is enabled by setting the `multipleSelection` property to `false`.

## Selection Events
To notify you when the selection state of an item is changed, `RadListView` exposes the following events:
* `itemSelecting` - fired before an item is selected. Can be used to cancel the operation
* `itemSelected` - fired after an item is successfully selected. At this point the item is already in the selected items array returned by the `getSelectedItems()` method
* `itemDeselecting` - fired before an item is deselected. Can be used to cancel the operation
* `itemDeselected` - fired after an item has been successfully deselected. At this point the item is not part of the selected items array returned by the `getSelectedItems()` method.

## Example
