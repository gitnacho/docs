# RadDataForm Overview

`RadDataForm` for NativeScript helps you edit the properties of a business object during runtime and build a mobile form fast and easy. All you have to do is set a business object as a value for the {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm,member:source %} property and {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} will automatically generate editors for each property of the source object. `RadDataForm` offers built-in editors for each primitive type and also has various features to help you create your desired form.

## Getting Started

The following articles contains everything you need to know to start using `RadDataForm`.

Then you can [describe the properties]({% slug dataform-start-properties-angular %} "Describe the properties in RadDataForm in NS") of the source in order to use the desired editors. Finally, you need to [get the result]({% slug dataform-start-result-angular %} "Get the result in RadDataForm for NS") from the user's input.

## Editors

`RadDataForm` for NativeScript allows you to select a proper editor for each property of your source object and optionally customize it according to your preferences.

Then you can have a look at the [complete list]({% slug dataform-editors-list-angular %} "List of Editors in RadDataForm for NS") with available editors and if none of them fulfils your requirements, you can create your [custom editors]({% slug dataform-editors-custom-angular %} "Custom Editors in RadDataForm for NS").

## Groups

You can easily combine the editors in groups and optionally allow them to be collapsed. More information is available [here]({% slug dataform-groups-overview-angular %} "Groups in RadDataForm for NS"). Once the editors are grouped, you can easily change the layout that is used for each group. More information is available [here]({% slug dataform-groups-layouts-angular %} "Group Layouts in RadDataForm for NS").

## Validation

If you need to validate the user's input before it's committed, you can use some of the predefined validators. [Here's]({% slug dataform-validation-overview-angular %} "Validation in RadDataForm for NS") more information about the validation in `RadDataForm` for NativeScript. [This article]({% slug dataform-validation-list-angular %} "List with validators in RadDataForm in NS") contains the full list of available validators and if they are not enough you can create you [custom validators]({% slug dataform-validation-custom-angular %} "Custom Validators in RadDataForm for NS").

## ReadOnly

If you need to use the form to simply show the content of the source object without allowing the user to edit the content you can make the form read only or just disable specific editors that shouldn't allow editing. You can read more [here]({% slug dataform-readonly-angular %} "ReadOnly mode in RadDataForm for NS").
