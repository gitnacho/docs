# RadDataForm Editors

If you followed the [getting started]({% slug dataform-start-source-angular %} "RadDataForm getting started") section, you now know how to edit an object's properties with `RadDataForm` for NativeScript. This article will explain how to change the editor that is used for a property, what editors are supported by {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} and how to use them.

## Figure 1: Some of the editors supported by RadDataForm on Android (left) and iOS (right)

## Usage

By default, {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} will load a default editor depending on the type of each property of the source object. If you need to change the type, you can provide another editor through HTML or code-behind. This is demonstrated in the following examples:

### Example 1: Change the editor that is used for a property through HTML

<snippet id='angular-dataform-editors-html'/>

### Example 2: Change the editor that is used for a property through code-behind

<snippet id='angular-dataform-editors-code'/>

Note that the {% typedoc_link classes:EntityProperty,member:valuesProvider %} property will be taken into consideration only for editors that support predefined list of values. These editors are {% typedoc_link enums:DataFormEditorType,member:Picker %}, {% typedoc_link enums:DataFormEditorType,member:SegmentedEditor %}, {% typedoc_link enums:DataFormEditorType,member:List %} and {% typedoc_link enums:DataFormEditorType,member:AutoCompleteInline %}. You can read more about the providers [here]({% slug dataform-editors-providers-angular %} "RadDataForm value providers").

## Converters

In the example in the beginning of the article the {% typedoc_link classes:EntityProperty,member:valuesProvider %} of the `EntityProperty` was set to an array of strings and the value of the property of the source object that was edited was also of type `string`. In some scenarios you will need to save a value which differs from the one that an editor displays. Consider the following example where you have a class `Movie` with two properties - `name` and `id`. If you want to save the value of the `id` and also display the value of the `name` in an editor, you can create a converter that will convert between the two values. Here's a sample implementation of the aforementioned scenario:

### Example 3: Use a converter to change the type of the editor value before it is saved in the source object

<snippet id='angular-dataform-converters-code'/>

As you can see in your model you can have a property of type `number` which represents the `id` of a movie which gets converted to the `name` of the movie with the same `id`. Similarly, when an item is selected from the list, its `name` is converted to the `id` which is the value that gets committed to the source object. An instance of the created converter has to be set to the {% typedoc_link classes:EntityProperty,member:converter %} property of the [EntityProperty]({% slug dataform-start-properties-angular %} "RadDataForm Describe the Properties") object.

## Additional Parameters

The {% typedoc_link enums:DataFormEditorType,member:Stepper %} and {% typedoc_link enums:DataFormEditorType,member:Slider %} editors have additional properties which you can be setup through {% typedoc_link classes:PropertyEditorParams %}. The following example of the {% typedoc_link enums:DataFormEditorType,member:Stepper %} editor shows how to limit its bounds and define its step:

### Example 4: Use editor params to adjust an editor

<snippet id='angular-dataform-editor-params-xml'/>
