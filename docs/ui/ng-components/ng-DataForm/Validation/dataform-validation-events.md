# RadDataForm Validation Events

If you followed the [getting started]({% slug dataform-start-source-angular %} "RadDataForm getting started") section, you now know how to edit an object's properties with `RadDataForm` for NativeScript. From the [validation overview]({% slug dataform-validation-overview-angular %} "RadDataForm validation overview") you should have become acquainted with the validation feature in {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %}. This article will show you how to use the validation events in {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %}.

* [Overview](#overview)
* [Validate](#validate)
* [Validated](#validated)
* [References](#references)

## Overview

There are two validation events that you can use to get notified when a property in {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} gets validated:

* **propertyValidate**: This event is fired while the value is validating and allows you to interfere and change the validation result.
* **propertyValidated**: This event is fired after the validation has finished and you can use it to check the final result from the validation.

## Validate Property

The **propertyValidate** event gives you an opportunity to change the validation result through {% typedoc_link classes:DataFormEventData, member:returnValue %} of the method's event args, for example for custom validation. You can also use it for asynchronous validation by setting the validation result to a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise" target="_blank">Promise</a> which will be later resolved with the result from the validation.

> Please note that if you are having [validators]({% slug dataform-validation-list-angular %} "RadDataForm validators"), for some property the **propertyValidate** event will be fired for this property only if all validators are successful. If you want to be notified for failed validation, use the **propertyValidated** event.

The following example demonstrates how to use the **propertyValidate** event to validate whether two fields contain the same value (for example for confirming passwords or emails).

### Example 1: Using propertyValidate event for matching fields

#### Figure 1: Using `propertyValidate` event to check for matching passwords on Android (left) and iOS (right)

This next example shows how to set the validation result to a `Promise` and validate the input asynchronously (for example to check whether a selected username is already used).

### Example 2: Using propertyValidate event to validate a field asynchronously

<snippet id='angular-dataform-property-validate-async'/>

In this example, we are simulating a slow and (almost) random validation for a property with name `username`. Also our page contains an <a href="https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/code-samples/ui/activity-indicator.html" target="_blank">ActivityIndicator</a> (named `indicator`) and a <a href="https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/code-samples/ui/label.html" target="_blank">Label</a> (named `label`) to show information to the user about the current validation state.

## Validated Property

The **propertyValidated** event gives you an opportunity to get notified that a property is validated and check what is the result from the validation. Here's an example:
