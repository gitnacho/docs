# RadDataForm - Provide the Source

This article will guide you through the process of adding a {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} instance to a page in a {N} + Angular application and using it to edit the properties of a business object.

## Create the Source Object

In order to use `RadDataForm` to edit an object, we need to have the object that we will edit. In this example, we will create a class `Person`, pass an instance of this class to `RadDataForm` and then we will be able to edit the person's properties.

### Example 1: Declare the object that we will use as a source for RadDataForm

<snippet id='angular-dataform-person'/>

## Add RadDataForm to the Page

Before proceeding, make sure that the {% typedoc_link classes:NativeScriptUIDataFormModule %} from the *nativescript-ui-dataform* plugin has been imported in an `ngModule` in your app as explained [here]({% slug dataform-overview-angular %}).

After that simply add the {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm %} tag to the HTML and set its {% typedoc_link classes:RadDataForm,member:source %} accordingly:

### Example 2: Add RadDataForm to a page

<snippet id='angular-dataform-getting-started-html'/>

Note the [data binding](https://docs.nativescript.org/angular/core-concepts/angular-data-binding.html) of the `source` property of `RadDataForm` to the `person` property of our component. Let's add this property in the `@Component` '.ts' file and initialize it in the `ngOnInit` method:

### Example 3: Define the property used for binding

<snippet id='angular-dataform-getting-started-context'/>

If you run the application now, you should see the default editor for each property of the provided source object.

Our next step is to adjust the editors that are used for each of the source object's properties. [Here]({% slug dataform-start-properties-angular %})'s how.
